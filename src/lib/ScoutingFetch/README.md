# ScoutingFetch
A small node.js typescript libary to make specific FRC related API requests easier

## Examples
The examples folder is meant to get you started and give a basic understanding of how to use the library, however the actual docs will do a much better job (for the most part (looking at you, Statbotics docs)) at explaining what the fetches actually do
- [The Blue Alliance API docs](https://thebluealliance.com/apidocs)
- [FIRST Events Web API docs](https://frc-api-docs.firstinspires.org/)
- [Statbotics API docs](https://www.statbotics.io/api/rest) (minimally useful docs tbh, great info on the site though)
